**Abstract:**  
This study focuses on the design and implementation of an MQTT-based system to visualize the behavior of autonomous vehicles in a virtual environment using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The primary objective is to simulate and monitor vehicle-to-environment and vehicle-to-vehicle interactions within a connected ecosystem. As advancements in IoT and intelligent transportation systems accelerate the transition from traditional to autonomous vehicles, there is a growing need for frameworks that enable cooperative decision-making beyond isolated sensor-based perception.

The proposed system builds a network in which each vehicle adapts its decisions based on the behavior of other vehicles, environmental conditions, accidents, and geofences, enabling the selection of efficient and safe routes. Using lightweight MQTT communication, the framework continuously transmits key parameters such as speed, battery status, and GPS location to a centralized monitoring system. The collected data are analyzed and visualized through graphs and charts, enabling real-time fleet-level insights.

The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of MQTT and IoT technologies for enhancing autonomous vehicle networks and provide a foundation for implementing scalable fleet management systems to study performance, safety, and coordination in virtual environments.
