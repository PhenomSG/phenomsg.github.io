I am an undergraduate student pursuing a B.E. in Information Science and Engineering at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bangalore, (CGPA: 9.0). My primary interests lie in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Generative AI, with a growing focus on LLM systems and agentic architectures.

I qualified GATE 2025, an experience that further motivated me to pursue graduate studies (M.S./M.Tech.) and strengthen my understanding of core computer science and AI foundations.
